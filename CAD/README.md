### Building BMO
This folder contains the necessary files in order to build each module. Each piece is laser 
cut on a 1/8" acrylic piece and press-fit together. For additional strength, I added super glue 
to a few of the walls, but left at least two openings to fix any internal electrical issues.

Each of the subfolders contains images of the layout of each module, which can serve 
as a guide to put them all together.

Let's get building!
